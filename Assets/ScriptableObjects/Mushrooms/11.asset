  mushroomName: 'Jellyfish cap '
  description: While it's one of the most common looking mushroom you can find around
    these parts, it still hides some peculiarities like the inrolled rim of the cap
    and the gills on the body that makes this look like a brown jellyfish
  realLifeDescription: The original mushroom is Paxillus involutus, a classic looking
    mushroom with a description very similar to the game one. One peculiar thing
    about this mushroom is that genetic testings suggest that it may be a species
    complex, instead of a single specie
