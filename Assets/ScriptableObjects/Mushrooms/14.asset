  description: Red wrinkly mushroom found in the wild. One of the most beautiful
    and loved mushrooms. Originally it was very rare to find and very precious, now
    its value has diminished as its abundance increased
  realLifeDescription: The real life mushroom is the rhodotus palmatus, one of the
    most beautiful british mushroom, also called wrinkled peach. As its counterpart,
    it was very rare, until an outbreak of a disease made its food source, rotten
    elm, much more frequent
